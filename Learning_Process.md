The most interesting thing in this video was about the Pomodoro Technique:

"The Pomodoro Technique is a way to manage your time better. It helps you work in short bursts with breaks in between."
-  **Two Modes of Learning:** Oakley introduces the concept of "focus mode" and "diffuse mode." Focus mode is for concentrated, focused thinking, while diffuse mode is for more relaxed, creative thinking.
- **Pinball Machine Analogy:**  The focused mode is like a ball moving along well-worn paths, while the diffuse mode is like a ball bouncing around randomly, exploring new possibilities.
- **Take a Break :**  When the timer rings, take a 5-minute break.
- **Repeat :**  Do this four times, then take a longer break of 15-30 minutes.

## 3.What are active and diffused modes of thinking?
- **Active Mode:** This mode is characterized by focused attention on a specific task or problem. It involves conscious effort and is ideal for tasks that require logical thinking, problem-solving, and detailed analysis.
- **Diffuse Mode:** This mode is characterized by a relaxed state of mind where the brain is not actively focused on a specific task. It allows for creative thinking, insight, and the formation of new connections between ideas.
